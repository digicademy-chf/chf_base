The Cultural Heritage Framework (CHF) is a research software suite that helps
you build web apps to **produce and publish data in the humanities**. It is
designed for the needs of scholarly editing, lexicography, archives, GLAM
institutions, and, more generally, projects interested in making cultural
heritage, books, media, or annotated bibliographies available in their own
web-based research platform. All components are organised around the TYPO3
extension ``chf_base``, which provides data resources used by dependent data
models. The various components are developed and maintained by the Digital
Academy, a Digital Humanities department at the Academy of Sciences and
Literature Mainz.
