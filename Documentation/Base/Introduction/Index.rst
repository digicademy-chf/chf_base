Introduction
============

The extension provides a number of database tables and corresponding classes
for use in the various dependent data models in the CHF. This includes
humanities-specific data such as ``Location``, ``Period``, and ``Actor``, but
also more generic classes like ``SameAs``. In the same vein of being a service
extension for other data models, CHF Base also includes key third-party
libraries like ``Leaflet``, infrastructure to import and serialise data, to
compile search configuration, and to build user interfaces. The latter is
realised in the form of generic Fluid templates that sitepackages may use
as-is, but also by means of a CSS library with complimentary JavaScript to
build accessible and responsive web apps from atomic components.

..  attention::

    The extension is not final yet. A lot of things may still change over the
    coming months.
