Any user-facing web project with dynamic components needs regular maintenance
and a TYPO3 system is no different. You should **regularly update your
instance** as instructed in TYPO3's `getting started guide
<https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/tutorial-getting-started/main/en-us/Index.html>`__.
Our goal for the CHF components is to always update all components for the
latest release, but we may not always be ready on day 1. Feel free to step up
and provide patches to aid this regular maintenance.

When we upgrade our components or make changes, we try to migrate everything
automatically. But especially if you heavily customise the CHF in your
sitepackage, **you may face a bit of maintenance work** to keep up with new
releases as TYPO3 continuously modernises its APIs with each major version.
