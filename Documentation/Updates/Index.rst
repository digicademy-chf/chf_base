Updates
=======

Any user-facing web project with dynamic components needs regular maintenance
and a TYPO3 system is no different. You should **regularly update your
instance** as instructed in TYPO3's `getting started guide
<https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/tutorial-getting-started/main/en-us/Index.html>`__.
The goal for CHF components is to always update all components for the latest
release, but these updates may not always be ready on day 1. Feel free to step
up and provide patches to aid this regular maintenance.

When components are upgraded and changes are made, the goal is to migrate any
content and data automatically. But especially if you heavily customise the CHF
in your sitepackage, **you may face a bit of maintenance work** to keep up with
new releases as TYPO3 continuously modernises its APIs with each major version.
