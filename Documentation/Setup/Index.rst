Setup

The CHF provides standard TYPO3 extensions, so the resulting web project
**will behave like a regular TYPO3 project**. The official `getting started
guide <https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/tutorial-getting-started/main/en-us/Index.html>`__
provides system requirements and installation instructions.

To **kickstart development**, you may simply use the Podman or Docker
containers provided CHF Container. Please refer to the documentation of the
container package to see how it works.

For inspiration on how to use the CHF, feel free to take a **look at two
in-use sitepackages**: ``namenforschung`` and ``corpusvitrearum``.
