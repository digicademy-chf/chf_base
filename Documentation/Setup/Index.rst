Setup

The CHF provides standard TYPO3 extensions, so the resulting web project
**will behave like a regular TYPO3 project**. The official `getting started
guide <https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/tutorial-getting-started/main/en-us/Index.html>`__
provides system requirements and installation instructions.

To **kickstart development**, you may simply use the Podman or Docker
containers provided CHF Container and/or the sitepackage boilerplate CHF
Project. Please refer to the documentation of the container package to see how
it works. Depending on your web server's set-up, the container may not be
useful and you may simply need an adapted boilerplate extension and activate it
in a PHP Composer environment.

For inspiration on how to use the CHF, feel free to take a **look at two
actual sitepackages** based on the boilerplate code: ``namenforschung`` and
``corpusvitrearum``.
