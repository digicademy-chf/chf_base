Specific usage instructions are provided **in each component's documentation**
where necessary. There are a few central concept in the CHF and the TYPO3

  the documentation for CHF Project.

- TYPO3 differentiates between **frontend and backend**, and editing is
  usually done in the latter.

- The content management system associates data with the page (or folder) it
  is added to.

  updates are released every couple of weeks at the latest, and it is your
  responsibility to keep your project up to date.
