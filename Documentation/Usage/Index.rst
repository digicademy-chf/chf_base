General notes

There are a few central concept in TYPO3 and the CHF that may come in handy:

- TYPO3 differentiates between **frontend and backend**, and editing is
  usually done in the latter.

- The content management system associates data with the page (or folder) it
  is added to.

- New major versions of TYPO3 are released **every 1 1/2 years**. Security
  updates are released every couple of weeks at the latest, and it is your
  responsibility to keep your project up to date.
