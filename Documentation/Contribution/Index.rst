Contribution
=============

The Cultural Heritage Framework is an open-source project. We **encourage
contributions** and have listed a couple of ways in which you could
contribute below. We only ask that the CHF community follows the
`**Contributor Covenant code of conduct** <https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/>`__.
Please contact us via the public email address in our GitHub profile if
you encounter a violation of the code of conduct so we can enforce this
shared set of rules. You are also free to contact us if you would like
to contribute but do not want to engage in our public repositories.

1.  Spread the word

    We love hearing from other projects using CHF components. Let us know
    or spread the word using the marketing resources we store in our code
    repositories.

2.  Report an issue

    Found something that does not work as intended? Report the issue in
    the repository of the affected component. Try to be as specific as
    possible so we can reproduce and test the problem.

3.  Add documentation

    Ran into a problem and wished the documentation was better? Help us
    improve by editing the documentation right in a component's repo and
    submitting a merge request. Or just message us.

4.  Fix a bug

    Any help with bug fixes is appreciated. If you know how to reproduce an
    issue and fix it, feel free to create and submit a merge request.

5.  Add a feature

    Feeling comfortable in the code base and need a feature other projects
    may benefit from as well? Just create an issue describing the
    enhancement and start working on a patch.

6.  Share your expertise

    Have an idea for how to contribute to the project with any other skill
    not listed above? Just contact us, we appreciate it.
