  The Cultural Heritage Framework (CHF) is a research
  software suite that helps you build web apps to **produce
  and publish data in the humanities**. It is designed for
  the needs of scholarly editing, lexicography, archives,
  GLAM institutions, and, more generally, projects
  interested in making cultural heritage, books, media, or
  annotated bibliographies available in their own web-based
  research platform. A key strength of the CHF is the
  ability to produce portals and editions that include
  various data types with historical points of reference in
  a single system, including editing interfaces, frontends,
  and serialisations. Specific data models are organised as
  additional components around the TYPO3 extension
  chf_base, which provides central data types like Agents,
  Locations, and Periods, but also services like import and
  export routines. The various components are developed and
  maintained by the Digital Academy, a Digital Humanities
  department at the Academy of Sciences and Literature
  Mainz.
