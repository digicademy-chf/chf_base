/**
 * Rules to map object inheritance to TCA tables
 * 
 * List of inherited object models and how they relate to TCA tables and
 * values of the property specified as 'type' in the TCA config. Simpler
 * objects based on tables of the same name and without multiple types
 * do not need to be listed here since Extbase maps them automatically.
 * For more information on the persistence of Extbase models see
 * https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-coreapi/main/en-us/ExtensionArchitecture/Extbase/Reference/Domain/Persistence.html.
